This is a direct transliteration into F# of Graham Hutton's Haskell parser 
combinators library from chapter 8 of his book *Programming in Haskell*.

It's not always quite idiomatic F# style, but I tried to stay pretty close to
the code in the book.

To run: Open solution, restore NuGet packages, run NUnit tests.
